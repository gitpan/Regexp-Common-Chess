NAME
    Regexp::Common::Chess - regexp for algebraic notation in chess

SYNOPSIS
     use Regexp::Common qw/Chess/;

     my $move = 'Rxh7+';
     if($move =~ /^$RE{Chess}{SAN}$/) {
             say "Yay! A valid chess move!";
     } else {
             say "Sad to say, that doesn't look valid...";
     }

DESCRIPTION
    This module defines a regular expression for use when parsing standard
    algebaric notation (SAN) as specified in the Portable Game Notation
    (PGN) standard (export format). It is not a complete PGN regexp. It is
    limited to only match one specific move at a time.

SEE ALSO
    The PGN format, including its SAN specification, is documented in the
    "Portable Game Notation Specification and Implementation Guide",
    available here:

    *   <http://www.chessclub.com/help/PGN-spec>

    The Regexp::Common manual documents the use of the Regexp::Common
    framework and interface, used by Regexp::Common::Chess.

AVAILABILITY
    The latest released code of this module is available from CPAN.

    The latest development, useful for contributing and for those living on
    the edge etc. is available from Github:
